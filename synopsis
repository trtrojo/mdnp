mdnp - Markdown Notepad

 A (as much as we can make it) serverless client app for writing notes in
   markdown.

  -Previously, ive been writing my notes in scintella/notepad but get
    frustrated with restarting or otherwise losing my session and my notes all
    disappear. mdnp will solve this by updating whatever you type into it every
    5 seconds. (maybe adjustable?) the backend storage will be some type of 
    cheap json storage service (jsonbin.io?).
